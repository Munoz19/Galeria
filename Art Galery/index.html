<h3><ins> Renaissance   </ins></h3>

<p> To place the historical context in which the Renaissance was experienced, we must mention the great relevance that Christianity had in all aspects of daily life. This stage in art history took place at the end of the 14th century and reached its peak during the 15th century.

    At this stage, art focused on making man the centerpiece of society and no longer God. The most important events of the beginning of the Renaissance were the fall of Constantinople, the discovery of America and the origin of capitalism.
    
    The artists returned to the ancient folklore of Greek and Roman culture such as languages ​​and intellectual values ​​and traditions. The jobs were no longer only for nobles or the government, but a bourgeois family could hire the services of these artists.</p>

<h3><ins>Neoclassicism</ins> </h3>

<p>Almost at the time when Rococo was gaining strength, Neoclassicism emerged as a stage in which the themes of Greek and Roman culture were taken up. We return to the basics, the drawings and the forms, valuing more the invoice of the final result and its historical theme.

    Thanks to the influence of the Enlightenment in all dimensions of life in Europe, Rome once again became the cultural capital of the West. Archaeological explorations are carried out to recover the mythical and artistic past.
    
    Artists such as Bouguereau and Jaques-Louis David are the most representative painters of this stage. Antonio Canova and Chaucey Bradley Ives are, in turn, the most characteristic sculptors of Neoclassicism.

<h3> <ins>Romanticism</ins> </h3>

<p>
    At the end of the 18th century, a stage was born in the history of art that would once again move away from the rational to approach human passion: Romanticism. It emerged in parallel in Germany and the United Kingdom as a response to the exhaustion of illustration.

In Romanticism the world is not conceived as intellectual and serene, but as imperfect, sentimental and brutal. The influence of medieval folklore and subjectivism inspired artists from different disciplines to portray a violent, crazy and rebellious reality.
